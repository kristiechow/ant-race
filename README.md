## Note from the developer
I had so much fun writing this app! If I had more time to refine, I would make the table UI more interactive and easy to look at, and consolidate some duplicate code in my onGetDataClick() function. The app is usable but not perfect on mobile, so responsivity could be improved. If this one-page app were to become part of a bigger race website interface, I could see a future need for redux for state management.
